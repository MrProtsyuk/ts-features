# ts-features

Hello!!! This repo is a collection of little code snippets of features within typescript.
These code snippets include: <br /> - types and what you get with typescript <br /> - Annotations : <br /> -- annotations within functions <br /> -- annotations within objects <br /> -- annotations within variables <br /> - arrays : <br /> -- annotations within arrays <br /> -- arrays within arrays <br /> -- array flexable types <br /> -- array helpers <br /> - tuples <br /> - interfaces <br /> - classes <br /> <br /> These notes were taken while following Stephen Griders Typescript course on Udemy, I recommend this to anyone who truly is tired of trying to migrate from javascript to typescript or anyone who has been working in c# or C++ and wants to get into web dev. This is the perfect course for you because he goes over the theoretical and the practical and helps you understand the technical parts of typescript that arent explained to you in a simple Youtube video. Hope this finds someone out there!
